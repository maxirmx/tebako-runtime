Tebako is an executable packager. It packages a set of files into a DwarFS file
system for read-only purposes.

After packaging the file system into an image, Tebako produces a single
executable binary that allows the user to execute a selected file from the
packaged software from a point in the file system.

Tebako image is essentially a patched Ruby with embedded filesystem as shown in the diagram.

Inside tebako image there are Ruby gems that acess native extensions and/or external libraries and/or data files.

If a gem loads native extension using rubygems features this call is intercepted, a copy extension shared object is placed to host temp folder,
all further calls to extension are routed to the copy of extension (Line 2 on the diagram)

Gems and extensions can reference other libraries, executable and data files using native system calls. Tebako cannot intercept such calls and route them correctly to
memory filesystem.  Such Gem shall be aware that they are running in tebako environment and offload required file from memfs to temporary folder.

tebako-runtime (this Gem) provides a set of tools to help Gems to work in tebako environment.
It is intalled automatically by the core tebako packager. There is no need to install it manually.
